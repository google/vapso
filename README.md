Visualizing Area-Proportional Set Overlaps in JavaScript

This project creates visualizations of area-proportional
set overlaps in JavaScript.

index.html runs the code in a browser window. Notice that there
is currently no UI for entering the actual overlap data - you have
to enter it by editing the source code.

The code requires three libraries to run:
- jQuery (called from CDN per default)
- jQuery Color (called from CDN per default)
- Color Mixer for subtractive color mixing, which is available on GitHub:
  https://github.com/AndreasSoiron/Color_mixer

You have to download color_mixer.js from there and point
index.html to the correct place to find it.
